    "Q1. what are the five key concepts of object-oriented programming(OOP)?\n",
    "Answer: bject-oriented programming (OOP) is a paradigm centered around objects and classes, offering a way to structure and organize code. Here are the five key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "Class: A blueprint or prototype defining attributes and behaviors (methods) that objects created from the class can have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: An instance of a class.\n",
    "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Restricting direct access to some of an object's components, which is a means of preventing accidental interference and misuse of the data.\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "A mechanism to create a new class from an existing class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new class (child or subclass) inherits attributes and methods of the existing class (parent or superclass),\n",
    "allowing for code reuse and the creation of a more specific implementation.\n",
    "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability of different objects to respond to the same method call in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Achieved through method overriding (a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass) or\n",
    "method overloading (multiple methods have the same name but different parameters in the same class).\n",
    "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP makes your code more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain."
